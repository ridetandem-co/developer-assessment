# RideTandem Technical Test

Welcome!

In this test, you will be improving a web application that displays live arrival times for a bus stop. Read the requirements below and make changes to the front-end and back-end of the application that you feel best meet all the requirements. You should spend no more than 2-3 hours in total. Use any tools you need to complete the task (e.g. Google, StackOverflow, NPM packages).

Once you are finished working, please email tech@ridetandem.co with your finished project or a link to a Git repository where the code can be viewed.

**Project structure**

Web - React TypeScript application accessible at http://localhost:8080. Generated with Vite (similar to Create React App). In the web folder, install the packages and run `yarn dev` to run this.

API - Node.js TypeScript application accessible at http://localhost:3000. Generated with Nest.JS framework (similar to Express.js). In the api folder, install the packages and run `yarn dev` to run this.

## Requirements

- The app should fetch and display bus times from the existing `\bus-times` API endpoint on page load
- The app should highlight when buses are due (1 minute or less til arrival)
- The app should automatically refetch the bus times every 10 seconds
- The user should only see routes that run on the current day of the week
- The app should match the design outlined in the mockup below

The app should have appropriate frontend unit tests.

Additionally, what are some other ways you might want to improve or extend this application? This could include changes to the user experience, front-end and/or back-end. Feel free to leave comments or implement these changes if you have time.
